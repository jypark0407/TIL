# 3. An Informal Introduction to Python 

* Distiguishing Input and Output : By checking the presence of Prompts (>>>)

## 3.1 Using Python as a Calculator

### 3.1.1. Numbers

** Operators **

`/` (Division) : Always returns `float`

`//` (Floor Division) : Returns integer value of Division

`%` (remainder) : calculate remainder

`**` : calculate powers

 `_`(underscore) : stores the value of the last expression in the interpreter.

[There are 5 cases for using the underscore in Python.] (https://hackernoon.com/understanding-the-underscore-of-python-309d1a029edc)

### 3.1.2. Strings

Enclosed in single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`

To use multiple lines, use `"""`

`\`is used to escape quotes

`print` returns more easily readable lines, by printing escaped quotes and new lines

* Print escaped quotes

```python
>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
'"Isn\'t," they said.'
>>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
"Isn't," they said.
```
* Print new lines

```python
>>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
>>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
'First line.\nSecond line.'
>>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
First line.
Second line.
```

* Use `r` before the quote to override special charaters like `\n`

```python
>>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline!
C:\some
ame
>>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote
C:\some\name
```

* Indexing Strings
- First character has index 0 

ex) python[0] --> "p"

- Index can also a negative number, counting from the right. In this case it starts at -1

ex) python[-1] --> "n"

* Slicing Strings

ex) python [0:2] --> "py"

* Length of String

- Use built-in function `len()`

### 3.1.3. Lists

* Strings vs Lists 
Can be concantenated, indexed and sliced.

Strings are **immutable** while Lists are **mutable**

`.append()` to add to the list (can only take one argument at one time)

### 3.2. First Steps Towards Programming

`while` loop

executes as long as the condition remains true. 

`end(',')` to avoid the newsline after the output


# 4. More Control Flow Tools

##4.1. `if` Statement

`elif,` short for "Else If" is useful to avoid too many indentations. 

##4.2. `for` statement

```python
>>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
...     if len(w) > 6:
...         words.insert(0, w)
...
>>> words
['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
```

if `for w in words:` then the loop would have gone on forever, crashing the computer!

`words[:]` create a slice of copy of the original list and the loop will only go over it. 

##4.3 `the range()` function
Generates artimetic progressions.

The given end point is never the part of the sequence, though

ex) range(5) --> 0,1,2,3,4

`iterable` 
function range() looks like it returns the list object, but actually the sequence it returns is not the list, thus saving the space. 

ex) range(10) --> range(0,10)
```python
for i in range(10): 
    print (i)
```
 
if you itereate over range(10), then it returns all the indices in the 'list' (not a real list)


## 4.4. `break` and `continue` statements, and `else` clauses on loops

## 4.5.`pass`statement

I don't really understand this one...

# 4.6. Functions

# 4.7. Defining Functions

`in` : This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.
