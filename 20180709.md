## Installing Jekyll in the local directory

First, check if Ruby is installed

My Mac has an outdate Ruby (installed 2015 - version 2.0)

Installing Ruby

 - Ruby needs other application programs to be installed. There are several ways to install Ruby. Here I chose **Package management system**, specifically [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) for MacOS.

 - Install Homebrew : 

   `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

- `$ brew install ruby`

  This should install the latest Ruby version.

then follow the rest... https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/



Jekyll is an open source project that gets frequent updates so use the command below to keep it to the latest version. Otherwise, the local site will look different when published on GitHub.

If you followed our setup recommendations and installed [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), run `bundle update github-pages` or simply `bundle update` and all your gems will update to the latest versions.
